Steganography Project for Team Mangos: 
Cameron Tucker and Ella Self


Design decisions:
We decided to ask the user to choose whether they wanted to encode or decode via number selection. The program will ask the user for each file in the decoding/encoding process, allowing full control for any compatible files within the directory.   


How to run the program:
"./steganography" 


Challenges:
Finding time to sit down and work on the project and discuss it together was a challenge. The logic (and debugging) in the encipher and decipher functions took the longest of any one aspect in the project. Making decipher work to determine the correct characters from the correct bits (and not go too far into deciphering past the text) was a slight challenge. 


How we shared the work: 
Worked together to discuss the assignment and find time to work.  Discussed branching off from the main when working to preserve the program when it compiles and to prevent making changes that affect the whole program.  Commented, edited, and tested the program individually in order to make sure the program runs.

Ella helped me document the code, test the code before merges, clean up debugging measures in the code and manage the branches properly to avoid overwriting or losing important work. She also provided the framework in the beginning with function prototypes, file documentation, and setting up each file we needed. Ella also worked to code error messages for invalid user input.
I wrote code in Steganography.cpp and debugged as well, helped proofread syntax, and tested the code along with Ella to ensure everything ran smoothly on the different machines. I documented the code in Steganography.h, and provided in line comments as I worked throughout Steganography.cpp. I also set up main.cpp with the user prompts and function calls.
We worked together to debug and make sure each requirement for the project has been met.
