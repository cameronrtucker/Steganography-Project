Steganography Project for Team Mangos: 
Cameron Tucker and Ella Self


Design decisions:
Decided to ask the user to pick whether they wanted to encode or decode via number selection.  Asked the user for each file.  


How to run the program:
"./steganography" 


Challenges:
Finding time to sit down and work on the project and discuss it together was a challenge. 


How we shared the work: 
Worked together to discuss the assignment and find time to work.  Discussed branching off from the main when working to preserve the program when it compiles and to prevent making changes that affect the whole program.  Commented, edited, and tested the program individually in order ot make sure the program runs.
